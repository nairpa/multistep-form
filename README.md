## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React-form-hook](https://react-hook-form.com/) - React hook for form creation
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind.css](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned how to create a reusable Stepper Component with React.js as well as how to use React-form-hooks for managing controlled inputs.  

### Continued development

For my future project I would like to design and code a Rest API and its front-end, trying to apply clean architecture's concepts.
